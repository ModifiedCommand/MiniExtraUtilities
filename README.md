# Mini Extra Utilties

I retextured them. Based on [Extra Utilities](https://ftbwiki.org/Extra_Utilities), [download here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-utilities).

Both Education Edition and Experimental Gameplay need to be on.

These are the only two, for now, I will add more later:
- [Compressed Cobblestone by CoinRaptor7111](https://mcpedl.com/compressed-cobblestone-addon/)
- [Angle Ring by SirQuackThailand](https://mcpedl.com/angel-ring-addon/)
